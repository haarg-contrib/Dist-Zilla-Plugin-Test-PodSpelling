- remove use of corpus files - inline them
- remove use of Test::Tester

- do not inline the list of directories to test -- use filefinders instead.
    or at least allow for not passing bin and lib into the list?

- develop prereqs also go into x_author_test




genio wants stopwords to be populated from a local file:
https://gist.github.com/genio/a5e6c8261e030d2514756ff1a38f90e4
see my notes on #distzilla on 2016-05-21.
it goes with https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=105676


14:59 < ether> genio: is there a wishlist ticket describing what you're asking for?
15:05 < genio> yes.  https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=105676
15:05 < dipsy> [ Bug #105676 for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-Test-PodSpelling: list of stopwords in external file ] 
15:07 < genio> and what I worked up: https://gist.github.com/genio/a5e6c8261e030d2514756ff1a38f90e4  although mine was a deliberately naive attempt (no docs, and the stopwords filename was not defineable, etc)
